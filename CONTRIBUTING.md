  return (
    <div className="my-component">
      <h1>{title}</h1>
    </div>
  );
};

export default MyComponent;
```

**Node.js/Express Specific:**
```javascript
// ‚úÖ Good
import express from 'express';

export const getClubs = async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const clubs = await Club.find();
    res.status(200).json({ success: true, data: clubs });
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(500).json({ success: false, message: error.message });
  }
};
```
